Simple-Sockets-iOS-App
======================

This example base on this guide http://www.raywenderlich.com/3932/networking-tutorial-for-ios-how-to-create-a-socket-based-iphone-app-and-server

Main goals for writing this code from scratch was:
 - Try new AppCode 3.0 UI Designer
 - Update original code using storyboards
 - Update original code for ARC
 - Use MVC pattern (as most guides on ReyWenderlich use only ViewControllers, while I wanted to delegate network functions to different class)
 - Use new Terminal, build in new AppCode 

Project was created in xCode, than all code and interface was created in AppCode 3.0. After writing whole app checked it with xCode 5.1.1 - runs perfect.
